🚀 Internship Projects at SkillCraft Technology
This repository contains projects completed during my internship at SkillCraft Technology, focusing on data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

📌 Projects Overview
1️⃣ Traffic Accident Data Analysis
✔ Explored accident dataset using Pandas
✔ Visualized accident trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn
✔ Identified accident hotspots using Heatmaps
✔ Analyzed factors influencing accident severity

2️⃣ Country Population Visualization & Distribution
✔ Used Pandas & Seaborn to analyze global population trends
✔ Created distribution plots to visualize population growth
✔ Compared regional populations using bar charts
✔ Identified outliers & trends in population density

3️⃣ Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset
✔ Explored survival rates based on gender, class, and age
✔ Visualized missing values & handled data imputation
✔ Built basic survival prediction models

4️⃣ Banking Decision Tree Classifier
✔ Built a Decision Tree model for loan approval prediction
✔ Used Pandas for feature engineering
✔ Visualized the tree structure using Graphviz
✔ Evaluated model accuracy with classification metrics
